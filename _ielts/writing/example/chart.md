The line graph compares the ==amount of electricity produced== in France using four different ==sources of== power ==over a period of== 32 years.

It is clear that nuclear power was ==by far== the most important ==means of electricity generation== over the period shown. Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year.

In 1980, thermal power stations were the main source of electricity in France, generating around 120 terawatt hours of power. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75 terawatt hours of eletricity each, and renewables provided ==a negligible amount==. Just one year later, nuclear ==overtook== thermal power ==as the primary source of electricity==.

Between 1980 and 2005, eletricity production form nuclear power ==rose dramatically to a peak of==  430 terawatt hours. ==By contrast==, ==the figure for== thermal power fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and ==remained at this level== for the rest of the period. Hydroelectric power generation ==remained relatively stable==, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-year period, but renewable electricity production ==saw only a small rise== to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.
