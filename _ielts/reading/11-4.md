## Research using twins

site: [Research using twins](https://mini-ielts.com/407/reading/research-using-twins)

> To biomedical researchers all over the world, twins offer a precious opportunity to **untangle** the influence of genes and the environment - of nature and nurture.

**untangle** /ʌnˈtæŋ.ɡəl/ *verb.* 解开

> Alternatively, by comparing the experiences of identical twins with those of **fraternal** twins, who come from separate eggs and share on average half their DNA, researchers can quantify the extent to which our genes affect our lives.

**fraternal** /frəˈtɝː.nəl/ *adjective.* 异卵双生的; 兄弟的

> If identical twins are more similar to each other with respect to an **ailment** than fraternal twins are, then vulnerability to the disease must be rooted at least in part in **heredity**.

**heredity** /həˈred.ə.ti/ *noun.* 遗传

**ailment** /ˈeɪl.mənt/ *noun.* 小病

> Studies of animals, for example, have shown that when a rat experiences stress during pregnancy, it can cause epigenetic changes in a **fetus** that lead to behavioral problems as the **rodent** grows up.

**fetus** /ˈfiː.t̬əs/ *noun.* 胎儿

**rodent** /ˈroʊ.dənt/ *noun.* 啮齿动物

> Other epigenetic processes appear to occur randomly, while others are normal, such as those that guide **embryonic** cells as they become heart, brain, or liver cells, for example.

**embryonic** /ˌem.briˈɑː.nɪk/ *adjective.* 胚胎的

> 'He was the **trailblazer**,' she says.

**trailblazer** /ˈtreɪlˌbleɪ.zɚ/ *noun.* 拓荒者; 创始人

> **Schizophrenia** was thought to be due to poor mothering.

**schizophrenia** /ˌskɪt.səˈfriː.ni.ə/ *noun.* 精神分裂症

## An Introduction to Film Sound

site: [An Introduction to Film Sound](https://mini-ielts.com/408/reading/an-introduction-to-film-sound)

> For example, in the highly successful science-fiction film 2001, little dialogue was evident, and most of it was **banal** and of little **intrinsic** interest.

**banal** /bəˈnɑːl/ *adjective.* 平庸的

**intrinsic** /ɪnˈtrɪn.zɪk/ *adjective.* 本质的; 固有的

> In this way the film-maker was able to **portray** what Thomas Sobochack and Vivian Sobochack call, in An Introduction to Film, the 'inadequacy of human responses when compared with the magnificent technology created by man and the visual beauties of the universe'.

**portray** /pɔːrˈtreɪ/ *verb.* 描绘; 扮演

> This use of dialogue **underscores** not only the dizzy quality of the character played by Katherine Hepburn, but also the **absurdity** of the film itself and thus its humor.

**underscore** /ˌʌn.dɚˈskɔːr/ *verb.* 强调; 在...下面画线

**absurdity** /əbˈsɝː.də.t̬i/ *noun.* 荒谬; 荒唐的想法

> This film presents pure **escapism** - largely due to its **frenetic** dialogue.

**escapism** /ɪˈskeɪ.pɪ.zəm/ *noun.* 逃避现实

**frenetic** /frəˈnet̬.ɪk/ *adjective.* 狂热的

> However, if the 'click' of an opening door is part of an **ominous** action such as a **burglary**, the sound mixer may call attention to the 'click' with an increase in volume; this helps to engage the audience in a moment of **suspense**.

**ominous** /ˈɑː.mə.nəs/ *adjective.* 不详的; 威胁的

**burglary** /ˈbɝː.ɡlɚ.i/ *noun.* 入室盗窃; 入室盗窃罪

**suspense** /səˈspens/ *noun.* 焦虑

> Such sounds are included so as to provide an appropriate emotional **nuance**, and they may also add to the realism of the film.

**nuance** /ˈnuː.ɑːns/ *noun.* [声音、色彩、感情、外貌或意义方面的] 细微差别

> We are probably all familiar with background music in films, which has become so **ubiquitous** as to be noticeable in its absence.

**ubiquitous** /juːˈbɪk.wə.t̬əs/ *adjective.* 普遍存在的

> Usually not meant to be noticeable, it often provides a tone or an emotional attitude toward the story and /or the characters depicted. In addition, background music often **foreshadows** a change in mood. For example, **dissonant** music may be used in film to indicate an approaching (but not yet visible) menace or disaster.

**foreshadow** /fɔːrˈʃæd.oʊ/ *verb.* 预示

- **anticipate** /ænˈtɪs.ə.peɪt/ *verb.* 预料

**dissonant** /ˈdɪs.ən.ənt/ *adjective.* 刺耳的; 不和谐的

> For example, a particular musical theme associated with an individual character or situation may be repeated at various points in a film in order to remind the audience of **salient** motifs or ideas.

**salient** /ˈseɪ.li.ənt/ *adjective.* 显著的; 主要的

> Yet, it is important to note as well that sound is often **brilliantly** conceived. The effects of sound are often largely **subtle** and often are noted by only our subconscious minds. We need to foster an awareness of film sound as well as film space so as to truly appreciate an art form that **sprang to life** during the twentieth century - the modern film.

**brilliantly** /ˈbrɪl.jənt.li/ *adverb.* 巧妙地; 明亮地; 鲜明地

**subtle** /ˈsʌt̬.əl/ *adjective.* 细微的; 精妙的; 明锐的

**sprang to life** 突然活跃起来
